	* Added save derivation to browser

2001-2-9   Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added cleaning of script dirs to top level makefile. 
	
2001-2-8   Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added grammar conversion for hand-written grammars. Accepts
	files in the format of xtag.trees.dat, treenames.dat and
	treefeats.dat and creates a grammar that can be used with the
	parser. 
	
2001-1-30  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Improved interface between POS tagger and parser. Added
	interface between runparser and tagger_filter which can be used in
	general to pass extra material to the filtering process which can
	occur before parsing.

	* Moved select_deriv and remove_redundancy from ./bin into
	./src/derivations

	* Automated some distrib creation tasks

2001-1-29  Rashmi Prasad  <rjprasad@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added utility to prune dead nodes from a derivation forest which
	can occur after running other pruning heuristics such as
	select_deriv.pl

2001-1-27  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added filter which runs an external POS Tagger and then filters
	trees based on the postag assignments. This filter is in
	src/filter/tagger_filter.pl

2001-1-22  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* updated code within USE_PARSER_HEURISTICS in parser/hparse.c to
	be compatible with other modifications in the parser

2001-1-19  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Increased hash table size in featchecker/main-checker.cpp

2000-12-22 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Fixed bug in xviewtree.tk

2000-12-15 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

2000-12-14 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added count of all lex trees into src/dict/check_syntax.pl

2000-12-4  Kate Forbes  <forbesk@unagi.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added interactive utility to prune derivations from a derivation
	forest 

2000-12-1  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Squashed once again the backptr bug that surfaced in the
	ChangeLog entry for 2000-11-5. 

2000-11-30 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Fixed some bugs in xtag.show.word and improved the user
	interface. 

	* Changed Makefiles to allow user to define location of perl
	binary. 
	
2000-11-29 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added utility "xtag.show.word" for viewing all elementary trees
	(with features) selected by a particular word in the syntax file.

2000-11-28 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Fixed df2dot after addition of topfeats to forest

2000-11-8  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added program xviewtree which draws elementary trees with proper
	bitmaps for substitution, adjunction, etc. but is more lightweight
	than bungee. Can be used to render user defined elementary trees
	to eps.
	
2000-11-7  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added client/server handling to runparser and buffering control
	of stdout and stderr to the parser using the prefs file.

	* Copied over the porting notes for the french grammar developed
	at Univ Paris 7 and related programs and files into the directory
	lib/francais

2000-11-7  William Schuler  <schuler@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added capability to feature checker of printing only the
	subforest whose trees match certain feature templates at the top
	of the derivation.

2000-11-5  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Fixed a bug in the parser which caused some valid derivations to
	go unreported. Certain sub-derivations were left dangling in the
	chart because some sub-derivations which violated the goal spans
	were co-opting their position when assigning backptrs. This fixes
	the bug pointed out by Naoki YOSHINAGA.

	* Changed behaviour when reading input from syntax file or from
	nbest input. Previously if a family or tree was not found in the
	grammar, the entire entry was junked. Now it is more fault
	tolerant, and attempts to continue with the remainder of the
	syntax entry.

2000-11-4  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Folded in several treebank processing tools into
	src/treebank/. It takes a processed Treebank (like Fei Xia's
	LeXtract which converts the Penn Treebank into derivation trees)
	and produces a grammar defn and various counts from the corpus to
	be used as model parameter values in a statistical parser.

	* Added installation of various treebank grammar modules.

2000-11-2  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added programs that checks consistency of the syntax flat file

2000-11-1  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Improved simple_filter

	* Upgraded the syn_db and prob_counts_db to BerkeleyDB 3.1

2000-10-23 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Folded in the treebank grammar using the standard grammar
	tools. The treebank syntax file requires running a special perl
	program: ./lib/treebank/synify_etree.pl

	* In order to better accomodate unknown words, the syndefault file
	can now contain multiple default entries in the same format as
	before.

	* Fixed several steps in the installation and removed some warning
	from the Linux compilation of files in ./src/parser/

2000-10-18 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Changed grammar and lexicon conversion programs to be completely
	language/grammar independent. All the input and output files are
	now specified using files in the ./lib directory. Removed all
	references to environment variables in these files.

	* As a result, installation now does not require any environment
	variables to be set for running the parser or the graphical
	programs.
	
2000-10-16 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added capability to separate syn db access (picking trees for
	each word in a sentence) from the parser itself. The parser
	accepts a list of lexicalized trees for each sentence in
	stdin. This allows insertion of arbitrary filters between syn
	access and parsing.

	* Implemented a simple filter in src/filter/filter.pl

	* Added options in runparser to run the parser with user defined
	filters between syn access and parsing.

	* Changed install scripts. Added installation options for a
	binary-only distribution for Linux and Solaris.
	
2000-10-15 Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* The top-down prediction of the span of each item in head corner
	parser is now sensitive to the spans of its goal item. Now longer
	sentences can be parsed much faster.

	* Fixed a bug in the top-down prediction of substitution nodes in
	a subtree where there can be possible adjunctions on intermediate
	nodes dominating the subst node.

	* Improved handling of selective prediction of left aux and right
	aux trees. Also sped up this processing by caching leftaux and
	rightaux values for treenodes (in hparse_hand).

2000-10-6  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Removed fixed size input buffers and made their size
	configurable at runtime using the prefs file.

2000-10-5  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Made a generic handler for preferences throughout the
	parser. Now prefs are loaded up from a file at runtime. This means
	that we no longer have to recompile to switch between different
	types of grammars or most kinds of parsing behaviour.

2000-10-4  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added capability to switch between the traditional definition of
	adjunction with exactly one adjunction per treenode to the
	alternative definition which allows multiple adjunctions per
	treenode. The extraction of derived trees from the forest has to
	be sensitive to which definition of adjunction is being
	used. Added a runtime flag to print_deriv which makes this
	explicit. 

2000-9-28  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Moved new version of feature checker into lem/src directory
	hierarchy. Now the parser and checker are in a unified
	distribution package. 

2000-9-27  Anoop Sarkar  <anoop@linc.cis.upenn.edu>

	* Added toplabels.dat to the grammar defn. It contains all TOP
	category labels, previously hard-coded which also includes the
	feature structure for the top label.

	* Added syndefault.dat to the grammar defn. It contains the
	default syn entry, previously hard-coded in the parser.

	* PRO is now displayed correctly in the derived trees.

	* Using toplabels.dat the parser now correctly assigns a start
	feature for each derivation. The feature checker was also updated
	to perform this extra unification at the root of the derivation
	tree. 

	* Fixed bug in src/dict/synify.pl which caused erroneous entries
	with duplicated words in the <<ENTRY>> field in the syntax file.

	* replaced shell parser wrappers with a general perl script called
	runparser 

	* created ChangeLog
