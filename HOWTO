Running the parser
------------------

1. To run the parser on a set of input sentences:

   % cd <install-directory>
   put the ./bin directory in your PATH variable

   % cd test
   % runparser +n testfile | print_deriv -b | showtrees
 
   (showtrees uses Tcl/Tk; if you get an error see the Troubleshooting
   section below).

   you can save the parser output to a file:

   % runparser +n testfile > outfile

   For more options on viewing the output of parsing, experiment with
   the options to print_deriv:

   % print_deriv -h

   Also, you can use 'indentrees' instead of 'showtrees' to view the
   parser output on a textual display.

2. To use the parser with feature structure unification: 

   % cd <install-directory>/test
   % runparser +c testfile | print_deriv -f | showtrees

   A window should pop up with parses that have had successful
   unifications. Pressing 'f' in the window shows you the feature
   structures of each tree. 

   To unify feature structures after parsing:

   % runparser +u outfile | print_deriv -f | showtrees

   (The directory ./src/browser contains an experimental Java based
   browser for derivation forests. It is still under development and
   probably will not work on all parser outfiles.)

3. Useful utilities that can be used on the output of the parser:

   % count_derivations outfile

   Returns number of derivations encoded in the derivation forest
   which is the output of the parser.

   % truncate_graph outfile

   Randomly samples derivations from the forest. this is very useful
   when examining sentences with a large number of derivations
   (typically before feature structure unification). For example,

   % runparser +n testfile2 | truncate_graph | print_deriv -b | showtrees 

4. Running the parser with lexicalized trees pre-assigned to words
   (the logprob values are ignored):

   % cd <install-directory>/test
   % runparser +n -d nbest_sample.in | print_deriv -b | showtrees

5. Running the parser with a POS tagger acting as a filter on the trees
   selected by the words, e.g:

   % cd <install-directory>/test
   % runparser -p +n -df ../bin/tagger_filter testfile > outfile

   -p indicates that the sentence final punctuation should not be
   removed since lack of such cues usually causes errors in tagging.

   Note that for this to work properly, you must have a POS Tagger
   installed and you must include the correct path and invocation for
   the tagger binary in the Makefile in this directory when installing
   this parser. If you want to add or modify the tagger binary, then
   run "make clean", edit the Makefile and follow the installation
   directions.

6. You can also choose to submit a previously tagged corpus to the
   parser. This is useful when you want to hand correct the output of
   a tagger. 

   For example, if you have a file called 'testfile' which was
   previously tagged to produce 'testfile.tagged' then you can tell
   the parser to utilize this file as follows:

   % runparser -p +n -df ../bin/tagger_filter \
          -pp testfile.tagged testfile > outfile

   It is important to keep the two files aligned. If you have the
   sentence final punctuation in the tagged file, then the "-p" option
   must be used. 

7. To see the derivation forest output directly as an and-or graph,
   first install the graphviz utilities (see INSTALL.src) and then:

   % cd <install-directory>/test
   % runparser +n testfile > outfile
   % rundot outfile

Looking at elementary trees from the grammar
--------------------------------------------

You can use the following utilities to view trees from the grammar:
(here we assume that we are using the english grammar)

1. xtag.show english <regexp>

  xtag.show can be used to view individual trees from the grammar.
  Any regular expression <regexp> can be used to match the tree names.

  e.g. xtag.show ^betaN[0-9]* will display all the relative clause
  trees

2. xtag.show.fam english <regexp1> <regexp2>

  xtag.show.fam can be used to view trees in families from the
  grammar.  Any tree family that matches <regexp1> and then each tree
  in that family which matches <regexp2> is displayed.

  e.g. xtag.show.fam ^Tnx0Vnx1$ ^alphaW[0-1]* will display all
  wh-extraction trees from the transitive tree family

3. xtag.show.word <lang> <word> [<regexp>]

   xtag.show.word can be used to view all trees lexicalized by
   <word>. In addition, the list of all such trees can be filtered by
   using the optional <regexp> parameter. Use ".*" if you want to see
   all selected trees.

   e.g. xtag.show.word english make "\[make\]" will show only those
   trees anchored by the single word "make", i.e. it will ignore
   multiply anchored trees for "make". To see all trees run the
   command xtag.show.word english make ".*"

Using the tree display window:

1, 2 and 3 stand for left, right and middle mouse buttons respectively.

Listbox window
--------------
	<Double-Button-1> => displays item

Display window
--------------
	<1>          => moves to preceding item
	<3>          => moves to following item
	<2>          => jumps to item named in Item entry
	<KeyPress-f> => shows features
	<KeyPress-q> => exits program
	<KeyPress-p> => saves encapsulated postscript to file

Feature window
--------------
	<KeyPress-q> => destroys feature window
	<KeyPress-p> => saves features to file as text

N.B: The greek letters alpha and beta in the tree names are represented
in the tree names as a "alpha" and "beta" prefix of the name
respectively.

Converting the XTAG English grammar for use with the parser
-----------------------------------------------------------

Go to the directory where you installed the package. Check the files in
the directory ./lib/english/ to check if the values match those in the
latest version of the grammar. Then execute these commands in your
shell:

  % setenv LEMINPUT /mnt/linc/xtag2/pub/english	
    (OR export LEMINPUT=/mnt/linc/xtag2/pub/english)
  % setenv LEMOUTPUT /mnt/linc/xtag2/anoop/lem
    (OR export LEMOUTPUT=/mnt/linc/xtag2/anoop/lem)
  % cd bin
  % ./create_tree_data ../lib/english/english_gram.ph
  % ./synify ../lib/english/english_lex.ph
  % cd ../data/english/
  % syn_db_create syntax.flat

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Installation does not work.

  You might have an old version of bash/tcsh which does not set the
  PWD environment variable. Type the following:

  % export PWD=`pwd`  (for bash users)
  % setenv PWD `pwd`  (for tcsh users)

- Problems with running showtrees or xtag.show/xtag.show.fam

  The problem is most likely a faulty installation process. Upgrade
  your bash to version 2.02 or later. If you are using Redhat Linux
  then you can simply run bash2 and then follow the installation
  instructions above to run the parser.

  Alternatively, if you cannot find bash ver2 installed on your
  machine and you do not want to download it from www.gnu.org and
  install it, then you can edit the Tcl/Tk and Perl scripts in
  <install-directory>/bin and <install-directory>/utils manually to the
  locations of wish (version 4.0 or later) and perl (version 5.x or
  later)

  Another reason for this might be that the installation was
  botched. Try manually linking the location of wish to the bin
  directory: 

  % ln -s <full-path-to-wish> <install-directory>/bin/wish

- Problems with perl script invocation

  If your are having problems with perl executing any of the perl
  scripts then try replacing the #! invocation with the one given
  below:

  #!/bin/sh -- 
  eval '(exit $?0)' && eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
  & eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'
	    if $running_under_some_shell;

  If even this does not work then upgrade your Bourne shell to
  bash-2.02 or later or edit the first line of all the perl files in
  the bin/ directories to point to your perl installation. Find the
  perl files with the command "cd <install-directory>/bin; grep perl
  *". Edit the first line of each file reported by grep to point to the
  location of perl.

- While parsing, - if you get a synerror, most probably the buffer
  size for syntax entries is not big enough. edit syn_entry.h in
  src/parser/ and increase the value for SYN_BUFSZ -- then run
  "make.install" in that directory.
