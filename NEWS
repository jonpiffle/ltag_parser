* Fixed heuristics for parser timeouts

0.11.0
------

* Added select_deriv: an interactive method for finding the preferred
  derivation from a forest

0.10.4
------

  _disallow_leftaux/rightaux settings

------

* perl binary location is now user-defined

  handling  

* added xtag.show.word

0.10.1
------

* Added xviewtree to src/bungee

0.10.0
------

* Added TOP feature structure unification over the forest.

* Added rudimentary client/server capability to runparser.

* Added buffering control in the parser using the prefs file.

0.9.3
-----

* Made processing of syntax file more fault tolerant. If a tree or
family mentioned in the syntax file is missing from the grammar, a
warning is generated as before, but the remainder of the syntax
entries are processed.

0.9.2
-----

* Fixed a bug in the parser. Certain missing derivations reinstated.

0.9.1
-----

* Added treebank distrib

0.9.0
-----

* Added src/treebank for programs that process a treebank to produce
  grammars and model parameters.

0.8.2
-----

* Improved installation to avoid recreation of syntax.db when
  debugging the source package

0.8.1
-----

* Added program that performs a consistency check over the syntax file

0.8.0
-----

* Upgraded to BerkeleyDB 3.1

0.7.1
-----

* Better filtering.

0.7.0
-----

* Ported the grammar conversion tools to the treebank grammar.

* runparser can now switch between the XTAG grammar and the Treebank
  grammar. 

0.6.4
-----

* Eliminated some compile-time warnings under Linux.

0.6.3
-----

* Removed bugs caused by elimination of environment variables in the
  programs that performed conversion of the XTAG grammar and lexicon.

* Fixed bug in syntax file creation caused due to changes made in
  previous version.

0.6.2
-----

* Removed dependence on environment variables like LEMHOME and the use
  of soft links to handle different file locations across
  platforms. These problems are now handled by the installation
  programs. 

0.6.1
-----

* Fixed a bug in the parser user interface which did not allow nbest
  input to the parser without going through syn_get.bin

* Merged all install scripts into top level Makefile.

0.6.0
-----

* Combined the nbest processing of lexicalized trees from the
  statistical parser into the generic parser. 

* Implemented generic lexicalized tree filtering mechanism between syn
  access and parser.

0.5.0
-----

* Added goal directed top-down prediction. This considerably speeds up
processing of long sentences.

0.4.0
-----

* Cleaned up parser code to make future changes to the behaviour
easier to control.

* Allows preferences for grammar style or parser behaviour to be
controlled using a file read at runtime.

* Added a more flexible command line parser interface.

0.3.0
-----

* Folded in statistical parser code with the non-statistical parser
that can be used with general XTAG-style grammars.

* Fixed bug that ignored the topmost start feature.

* Included the feature unification package into the current source
tree instead of installing as a separate package.

* The set of start symbols and the default entries are now part of the
grammar definition.

0.2.0
-----

* Switched to a derivation forest output with associated tools. 

0.1.0
-----

* Initial release
