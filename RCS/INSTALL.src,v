@added instructions for setting up the parser to run with an
external POS Tagger.
@

Requirements
------------

* Berkeley DB version 3.1.xx
  available from http://www.sleepycat.com/

* Perl version 5 or later

* egcs 1.1b or later

* Tcl/Tk version 4.0 or later

Install steps
-------------

1. Go to the toplevel directory where you unpacked the tar file.
   Edit the Makefile to reflect the location of programs in your local
   installation. 

   Run "make all"

   It might take 5-20 minutes to complete all the compilation
   steps. If it takes under a minute, please give me an account on
   your machine.

Read the HOWTO file for instructions on running the parser.

If you have problems with running "make all", use instead the
command "env PWD=`pwd` make -e all".

Optional install steps
----------------------

* The TAGGER value in the Makefile has to be set to any POS Tagger that
  uses the Penn Treebank tagset. Recommended tagger to use is MXPOST by
  Adwait Ratnaparkhi available for download from:
  http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~adwait/statnlp.html

  Once you install the tagger, edit the value for TAGGER in the
  Makefile in the current directory. See the file HOWTO for
  instructions on running the parser with the tagger.

* Install the following packages

  1. Graphviz utilities
     (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/)

  2. Berkeley Yacc for Perl output
     (ftp://ftp.sterling.com/local/perl-byacc.tar.Z) 
     Compile perlyacc and install into $LEMHOME/bin

  To see derivation graphs, put dot (part of Graphviz utilities)
  into your PATH environment variable. Read the HOWTO file for
  instructions on using the graph viewer.

* Berkeley DB

a7 7
  Any 2.7.x version should work although we have extensively tested
  only with version 2.7.5.  Version 3.x of Berkeley DB also apparently
  works without any modifications.

  After installing Berkeley DB, insert the directory where db_load can
  be found into your PATH environment variable.

3. Each time you want to run the parser, first run "source
   setup_paths.sh" (for tcsh users: "source setup_paths.csh")
